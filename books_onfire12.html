		  Zara Chabby, seasoned as a well-worn saddle, his skin baked to terracotta by countless desert suns, squinted at the horizon. Solitude, his silent mistress, trailed him like a wraith across the sun-bleached dunes. He craved her embrace, 
		  the whispering emptiness that cleansed the soul like monsoon winds.
		  </p> 
		  
		  <p>
		  His camel, Ishmael, a shaggy relic of countless treks, snorted, kicking up a dusty halo. "Patience, old friend," Zara rasped, his voice a dry rustle against the endless silence. Days bled into each other, marked only by the sun's fiery chariot ascending and descending the velvet sky.
         But today, the desert held a different breath. A shimmer on the horizon, a mirage birthed from longing, or perhaps something more. As Zara ventured closer, the shimmering mirage solidified into a palm tree, its fronds swaying in a breeze he couldn't feel. Beneath it, a well gleamed like a fallen star, promise glittering in its depths.

		  Hesitation, a rare desert flower, bloomed in Zara's chest. Was this an oasis, a cruel jest of sun and thirst, or something else entirely? Curiosity, that restless desert wind, tugged at his beard. He dis-mounted, the sand singing beneath his calloused feet.
Kneeling at the well's edge, Zara peered into the inky black water. His reflection, a map of sun-etched wrinkles, stared back. He dipped his weathered hands, the coolness a shock against his sun-baked skin. As he brought them up, a single golden coin glinted between his fingers.
No ordinary coin. Etched on its surface was a swirling galaxy, stars dancing in miniature. A gasp es-caped Zara's lips. He'd seen these symbols before, whispered in campfire tales by nomads under moonlit skies. They spoke of the Starfall Gate, a hidden portal said to lead to other worlds, other lives.

		  </p> 
		  
		  <p>
		  The coin, heavy with possibility, warmed in his palm. Was this the solitude he craved, not an escape from this world, but a journey beyond it? Fear and excitement wrestled within him, two vultures circling a carcass. He glanced at Ishmael, the beast's wise eyes seeming to urge him onwards.
With a muttered prayer to the sun, Zara tossed the coin into the well. The water erupted, a silver geyser spraying him with liquid light. His heart hammered against his ribs as the well's darkness yawned open, revealing not stars, but swirling sand.

		  He plunged in, the sand swallowing him whole. The world dissolved into a whirlwind of grit and wind, then reformed into a sunlit cave, eerily cool despite the desert heat. A woman, eyes like pools of molten gold, sat cross-legged on a woven sand rug.

		   Choices, a viper s nest, lay before Zara. He could wander the tapestry, stepping into lives untold, experiencing a thousand suns in a single breath. 
Or, he could return to his desert, solitude clinging to him like a desert cloak.<br>
But before he could choose, the cave trembled. A guttural roar echoed through the sand, shaking the very bones of the earth.
 The woman's golden eyes flared.

		   Understanding, sudden and sharp, pierced Zara's heart. He had misunderstood solitude. 
		   It wasn't an escape, but a responsibility, a wellspring of empathy for the countless souls lost in their own deserts.
He turned to the Devourer, not with fear, but with outstretched hands. The shadows recoiled, then, hesitantly, met his touch.
